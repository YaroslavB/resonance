# OAuth 2.0

Resonance provides built-in support for OAuth 2.0 by integrating the 
[thephpleague/oauth2-server](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-server)
library.

Resonance provides a way to set up all aspects of OAuth 2.0 integrations
through PHP attributes and comes in with sensible configuration defaults. It
also integrates with other framework's features.
